                        <p>Our YT channel is already Live, we plan to upload all full M00Sik NFTs on the YouTube Channel and try to monetize the videos with the power of NFT community. They are your NFTs, the more you promote the channel, more money you can earn from them. All the money earned will be distributed among NFT Owners. We will just keep a low % fees.</p>

                        <p>We believe that our collectors must have more benefit so we have decided to set Royalty at just @ 0.7 %. We know that when we are achieving our goals, these NFTs will be worth way more and 0.7 will be enough for us to further develop our project.</p>

                        <p>This will not be end for us but a start. We want to create and entire ecosystem around our NFTs and make them as utility tokens for continually benefitting from what we build. Some other things we have in mind are Our own NFT marketplace with minimum fees, Play to Earn game, collab with famous singers, bring our own song out and sell as NFTs and so much more. Our current NFT holders will be benefit from every action we take.</p>
